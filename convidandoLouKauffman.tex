In my name and in the name of the recently (four years ago) created
{\em Programa de Doutorado em Matemática Computacional da
Universidade Fedral de Pernambuco} we would like to invite you for a
scientific visit  to our Programme during the period Jan,\ 2--13,\
2007. In this period you would give one or two talks, continue your
scientific colaboration with Prof. Sóstenes Lins of the Departamento
de Matemática and would be a member of the Examination Committee for
the PhD defence of our first graduate student to defend a thesis,
Lauro Didier Lins on Jan 11, 2007. The thesis subject is a
computational approach to the classification of $3$-manifolds by
means of blinks and the quantum invariants, a topic you have been
one of the pioneers (by its close association with the Kauffman's
bracket) in the beginning of the 1990's. We hope that you accept
this invitation and thank you in advance for the prestige that your
visit will attach to our Programme. \vspace{25mm}
