I would like to thank my supervisor Sóstenes Lins, who is also my
father. I owe to him many things: to exist is obviously the most
important one, but here I want to mention the opportunity that
he gave me to, using my skills, contribute to the yet mysterious
field of 3-dimensional spaces. He presented me
an unexplored and elegant way to present spaces and said:
``Let's use computers to explore this''. And this is what we
did, and I am very happy with the process and with the result we
achieved.
